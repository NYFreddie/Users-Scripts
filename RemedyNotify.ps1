# Contributor   : 2016 United Natural Foods, Inc.
# Control       : "@(#) Revision: 2.0.1"
# History       : 2016/01/15 - 1.0.0 - KAV - Created
#               : 2016/01/15 - 2.0.0 - PWM - Heavily hacked upon
#               : 2016/01/22 - 2.0.1 - PWM - Introduced Recovery Instructions
#############################################################################
#
# CONFIGURATION
# Parameters on this job to be defined:
#   SendAs          - Fully qualified email address to send the email as.
#   SMTPServer      - Email server to use as a relay host.
#   CriticalAddress - Email address to send Critical priority alerts to.
#   HighAddress     - Email address to send High priority alerts to.
#   MediumAddres    - Email address to send Medium priority alerts to.
#
# Other parameters/variables to be defined:
#   AssignmentGroup - Group to assign the ticket to.
#   Priority        - The priority to assign to the ticket.
#   Threshold       - How many consecutive failures before opening a ticket.
#   Unique          - True:  The ticket should only be cut the first time the
#                            threshold is reached.
#                     False: A ticket should be cut every time the threshold
#                            is reached. This is determined via a modulus
#                            operation on the consecutive failures against
#                            the threshold definition.
#
#    These may be defined on any of the following, in reducing priority:
#      1. Parameter on the Executing Job
#      2. Variable in the directory for the Executing Setup
#      3. Variable in the parent directory for the Executing Setup
#      4. Continue through the parent directory tree through the root
#         directory
#      5. Failure to find a configuration will result in a value of "not
#         found"
#
# EXECUTION
# This script will take action based on the values presented in the provided
# configuration. The end result is sending an email to the appropriate
# recipient based on the priority setting. Included in the email will be the
# following criteria:
#
#   From: <defined sender>
#   To: <defined recipient>
#   Subject: Failed job: \path\to\failed\job\example_job
#   Job failure identified at 01/22/2016 08:34:12 AM
#
#   Job name : example_job
#   Entry ID : 1234
#   Job location : \path\to\failed\job
#   Setup name : example_setup
#   Setup location : \path\to\failed\setup
#   Exit status : fail
#   Exit severity : Error
#   Exit code : 1
#   Last success : 01/22/2016 07:35:00 AM
#   Error count since : 1
#
#   Log is attached
#
#   ======Job Recovery Instructions======
#   <contents of Recovery Instructions for the job>
#
#   ======Setup Recovery Instructions======
#   <contents of Recovery Instructions for the setup>
#
#   ASSIGNED PRIORITY : <priority setting>
#   ASSIGNED GROUP : <assignmentgroup setting>
#
# Note that the Recovery Instructions for both the job and the setup are
# included in the email. Additionally, the log for the failed job is also
# attached.
